                            While it's not immediately apparent from the screenshot, Apple's website has a very good
                            implementation of hierarchy. As you scroll, you get the main products they're trying to
                            push,
                            from their new iPad, to their "new" purple iPhone, and eventually you get towards their
                            less important items which are separated into columns towards the bottom.

                            YouTube is a very well thought out project. It's use of repetition is excellent. It works
                            hand in hand with their algorithm, which is designed to keep users on their site as long as
                            possible. Because of this, the UI is designed to show in an attractive way the next
                            "recommended"
                            video for you to watch. It was all very intelligently engineered to end up in this way.

                            Google is a pretty obvious example for this design principle.  It knows what you're there to
                            do and doesn't deviate from that fact.  It's a very simplistic design which allows for easy 
                            access to what you're there to do.  No ads to clutter it or, really, any clutter at all.
